**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Designer/Problem Solver`**

Hey there! I'm a software developer with experience from HSBC and a Master's from the University of Windsor. I've got a thing for crafting cool stuff on the web, especially when it comes to software development especially frontend techniques.

I'm all about that sweet spot where creativity meets tech. I get a kick out of working on frontend projects that not only look awesome but also run like a well-oiled machine. You know, the kind that challenges you to make things both super fast and super slick.

 I'm all about the challenge of creating sites that are both lightning-fast and visually captivating. I've made it my mission to explore inventive ways to design seamless, user-friendly experiences.
